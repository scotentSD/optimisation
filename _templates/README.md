## How to create a new post for the timeline

1. open the file 2019-01-01-template.md in the draft or templates folder
2. edit
3. select all : ctrl+A , and copy Ctrl+C
4. go to the **_posts** folder and **create a new file** there
5. this file should be named with the same structure as the template, but also adding the reverse date after the name: **yyyy-mm-dd-name-dd-mm-yyyy.md** (don't forget the .md!) The first reverse date will be driving the post order in the timeline, the second date after the date, make the name unique and will be used in the url to the post when cliked on.
*To create the name of the file: type the name of the file in the rectangle above the edit area it should say international/_posts/ then the rectangle input box*
6. paste the content of the template ctrl+V
7. make your changes
8. save by commiting your file, enter your initials, and a short commit message

## How to use the template

1. do not edit the layout, it should be **layout: post** 
2. edit the **title** to what you want it to be
3. **type** will change the colour background of your title: pick one between: **lab, online, a11y, other, partner**
4. edit the **phase**: discovery, alpha, beta, live
5. put your **initials**
6. add the **date**. Format is: number in digits plus th, st, nd or rd Month in letters, and year
7. **optional** add a url to go back to the timeline page using "" around it or leave blank if not needed
8. **optional** add the **type_of_event** if you want it displayed added to the heading when the post is clicked on (Lab Testing, Partner co-creation and co-design, Accessibility, Online research and testing, Events, F2F and testing) or leave empty if not needed
9. fill in the text of your post
10. any files you want to link to should be uploaded before in the folder **files**. 
11. to link a file, **`[name of your file to display (type of file)](../files/name-of-your-file.extenstion)`**

Remember to mention what type of file it is in the text link. For example: 

`[Partner Prioritisation Spreadsheet (Excel file)](../files/SEP-Partner-Prioritisation-020819-V1.xlsx)`
